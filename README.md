# TORO

TORO is the name of my Tennis bOll RObot.

Some day in the future, TORO should be able to drive and navigate on a tennis court, search for tennis bolls, approach them, pick them up and eventually bring them back to me. It would also be nice to make TORO in a more generalistic matter so it can adapt or be adapted to different kind of bolls (such as golf bolls for example).

This repo contains general notes, electronic circuits, 3D parts and code of TORO. It is nowhere near being finished but will hopefully be some day. When this is the case, I might upload more detailed instructions on how to built TORO.
